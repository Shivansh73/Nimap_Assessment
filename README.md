# Nimap_Assessment
This repository contains a simple Spring Boot application designed to demonstrate basic CRUD operations using Spring Data JPA, Hibernate, and MySQL.

Features
Spring Boot 3: Uses Spring Boot 3 for easy configuration and application management.
Spring Data JPA: Provides an abstraction layer over Hibernate for database operations.
MySQL Integration: Configured to work with a MySQL database using HikariCP as a connection pool.
Simple CRUD Operations: Implements basic create, read, update, and delete operations for entities in the database.
Prerequisites
Before running the application, make sure you have the following:

Java 17 or later: The application is built with Java 23.
MySQL Database: Set up MySQL locally or remotely. Ensure a database is created (e.g., cpdatabase) and configured correctly.
Setup
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/Shivansh73/demo-application.git
cd demo-application
Configure the MySQL database: In src/main/resources/application.properties, update the following properties with your MySQL credentials:

properties
Copy code
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/cpdatabase
spring.datasource.username=root
spring.datasource.password=Lnct@2024
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update
spring.jpa.show-sql=true
spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.dialect=org.hibernate.dialect.MySQL8Dialect
Install dependencies: If youâ€™re using Maven:

bash
Copy code
mvn clean install
Run the application: Once the setup is complete, you can run the Spring Boot application with:

bash
Copy code
mvn spring-boot:run
Alternatively, you can run the application directly using the Java command:

bash
Copy code
java -jar target/demo-application.jar
The application will start on port 8080 by default.
